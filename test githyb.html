<h2>I Resources</h2>
<p>Resource are basically different unit currency, they have many use to help players through their journey. There are two type of resources: basic and unique resourece:
    <h2>1.Basic resources:
    </h2>
    <p>Basic resources appear at the early stage of the game, They help you build, upgrade and maintain your park. There are 4 basic resources in the game include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cash</li>
        <li>Coin</li>
        <li>Food</li>
        <li>DNA</li>
        <p>1.Cash</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>1.1 Cash</h3>
    <p> Cash is mainly a reward for achieving goals, though the availability of temporary missions in Jurassic World is much higher and therefore Cash is much easier to obtain. 
        Cash is also commonly won in card packs and as rewards at the Prize Drop.
        On occasion, Cash can be obtained at the Trade Harbor in exchange for other InGen resources.
         It cannot be obtained in custom trades, except for in exchange for animal assets.
         Like other resources, Cash can be purchased in the market.It is the only resource which can be purchased using real-world money.
    </p>
    <h3>1.2 DNA</h3>
    <P>DNA is the ONLY resource you can not buy with Dino Bucks. You can get DNA by winning a battle stage, getting in a card pack, arena showcase, selling dinosaurs , or winning it as one of the random prizes in live arena. 
        You can spend DNA in the dinosaur market. Selling dinosaurs can get back half of the DNA spent.
         In addition, DNA can be used during hybridization, which is performed by cross-referencing two specimens of different species which themselves have already been put through the artificial evolution process.</P>
<!--can add more amiges relae to DNA if you want to-->
<img src="images/DNA.webp">
<p>A picture of DNA pack.</p>

<p>
        A second type of DNA, referred to as “S-DNA” (meaning “super-DNA”), was developed in 2015 as well. This is a more specified, resilient form of the molecule which is essential in superhybridization.
         S-DNA belongs to a particular species, rather than acting as filler like the usual DNA utilized in Jurassic World. A superhybrid is defined as a hybrid animal in which one of the species sourced is, itself, a hybrid. 
         For example, the Indoraptor superhybrid is created by fusing S-DNA sourced from Velociraptor into the Indominus rex genome. In this way, the species which was the source of S-DNA need not have one of its specimens sacrificed for the hybridization process.

        <img src="images/Micro_S-DNA_Pack.webp" height="'320" width="240">
       <h4>A pack of micro S-DNA</h4> 
        A third type of DNA called “B-DNA” (meaning “boss DNA”) was also developed in 2015. This type of DNA is used in the creation of “boss” animals, which are vastly more powerful and resilient than any naturally-occurring animal or even Henry Wu’s strongest hybrid creatures. Most boss creatures are exceptionally larger than their closest biological relatives and exhibit abnormal traits, such as unnaturally-colored bioluminescence, high levels of bioelectric activity, and the ability to rapidly revive from fatal wounds with more health and physical strength than before. B-DNA is awarded to park managers for completing specified missions, most of which revolve around normal park activity.
         The species that can be created using B-DNA are made available on a rotating basis.
        It should be noted that while S-DNA and B-DNA are the official terminologies used in L/M canon, they are not scientifically correct.
         In actual scientific procedure, their names would be formatted instead as sDNA and bDNA. In this same way, DNA from ancient sources is referred to by real scientists as aDNA, meaning “ancient DNA.”
        DNA can be obtained by Jurassic World’s park managers at the Trade Harbor in exchange for other resources, and is a common reward in card packs or at the Prize Drop. It is also commonly given as a reward for completing missions, and is given when a Code 19 is resolved without an animal escape. VIP managers have an additional means of generating DNA; they are given blueprints for a DNA Production Site, a laboratory which can produce filler DNA in twelve hours. After four months of VIP membership, the blueprints for an S-DNA Production Site are given as well.</P>

    <h4>B-DNA icon</h4>

    <h3>1.3 Coin</h3>
    <p>Coins are the standard form of currency in the L/M universe, they are obtained as a form of profit and can be used in most types of normal transactions.
         In-universe references to real-world currency have been made; Coins are not directly referenced but appear to be representative of the currency used by the player.
          For example, American players can consider Coins to be representative of U.S. dollars. In this way, Coins can be used as a universal currency by all players.
          The primary source of Coins in de-extinction theme parks is the park attractions, animals generate revenue while they are awake and entertaining guests.
           Higher-level animals, and rarer animals, generally accrue larger quantities of Coins.
           Coins are being used to buy buildings and decorations, help you produce food and participate in some events
           <hr>
           <img src="images/CAB05AB3-E6EA-43C7-AA31-8AB020BAE889 (1).jpeg" height=""340 width="220">
        </p>
        <h3>1.4 Food</h3>
        <p>With an ever-increasing number of animals to feed, Jurassic World needed a different method of food production. As early as 1998, all the animal assets from Aquatic and Glacier Parks were transported via the S.S. 
            Arc Atlantic to Site C, and eventually new specimens were cloned for exhibition in smaller Jurassic World facilities. Food production was moved onsite to the Food Factory, a large building located to the east of Main Street where meat, crops, and fish could all be delivered. 
            The facility can be upgraded regularly to increase the amount of time it remains operational before reaching capacity. 
            Meat is usually prepared for the animals rather than fed live, while crops in the form of various plant species are seeded and grown within the paddocks directly for the animals to feed from. A farm is located on the island where livestock are raised before being transported to the Food Factory. 
            For VIP park managers, the Food Factory can be supplemented by the additional VIP Food Factory after two months of membership.
            Semi-aquatic piscivorous animals are usually fed dead fish while the majority of fully-aquatic species are given live fish, though there are exceptions in both cases. 
            The fish used varied depends on the species being fed, with salmon, tuna, and sharks all being fed to animals in the park. Crustaceans are no longer used as a major food source; all aquatic species are fed fish instead. 
            Live food is provided to some of the animals of the Biodome, with food animals including the Central American agouti (which is native to Costa Rica) and the dodo (which is a de-extinct animal cloned by InGen).</p>
            <h3>1.5 Amber</h3>
            <p>
                mber is a resource obtained by gaining Prestige Levels for Bosses or by participating in Boss Showdown events. 
                This resource is used to purchase creatures whose unlock events are incredibly rare. 
                Species like Tuojiangosaurus, Pyroraptor, Rajasaurus and Sarcosuchus are notable for this. 
                Amber can only be used in the Amber Market.
            </p>

<h4>Food icon</h4>
<img src="images/200438d10d18a846f109.jpg">
<h4>You can level up your creatures by feeding it with food</h4>
<p>There is another resource in the game, which is opposite the others. You can only obtain it through opening card packs or participate in particular event:</p>
<img src="images/69B860A3-3EAD-4995-B946-9DFE4EAB84E5 (1).jpeg">
        <ul>
        <li><h4>Loyalty points</h4></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Loyalty Points are a type of currency used in the L/M canon universe. They are specific to Jurassic World, where they are awarded to park managers over time. 
        Loyalty Points can be exchanged for exclusive assets; because they are awarded in double quantity to VIP managers, this means that VIPs will have access to these exclusive rewards sooner than others.
        The chief source of Loyalty Points is opening card packs. Depending on the pack’s rarity, varying quantities of Loyalty Points are awarded along with them; rarer packs or those that are won through more difficult or uncommon challenges come with larger amounts of Points. 
        VIPs receive twice as many Points when opening a pack.
        Loyalty Points can also be obtained through the Trade Harbor in exchange for other assets. This implies that Loyalty Points have value outside of InGen, but this is not expanded upon in the mobile canon.<br>

    <li>Aquatic cage</li>
    <p>Aquatic cage is basically a large pool that contain all the Aquatic creatures in it, it doesn't split into types like Land cage.
       Aquatic cage located in a large swimming pool which have a mosasaurus swimming around in it.
       Usually you can only access to aquatic cage at level 30, because at level 30 your battle stage will unlock and have a prize as a Prognathodon
    which is your first aquatic creature. However, if you somehow manage to unlock aquatic creature before level 30(through packs or participate in event),
you are still allowed to access to aquatic cage.</p>

    <p>Just like the Aquaic cage, Cerazonic cage is basically a big blue green house that contain all the Cerazonic creatures in it.
        Like the Aquatic cage, you can only access to it once you complete battle stage level 40 to earn your first Cerazonic creature isDeinotherium.
        However, if you somehow to hatched a Cerazonic creature in the early stage without complete battle stage level 40(packs,events...).You are still allowed to access to Cerazonic cage.

<h3>2.Static</h3>
<p>Static buildings are buildings that have some function(s) the user can access, but they can not be bought and placed, or moved. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <img src="images/24f4aad80111a44ffd00.jpg" height="240">
    <li>2.1 Food Production 
        <p>The food production factory produces food for coins.In the tutorial, Claire shows the player how to make food with 600 coins. 
            This factory is a free building and costs zero coins. However, the player can not sell this Building. 
            This has levels where the player can upgrade with coins and cash for faster food production in a longer period of time.</p>

                <p>The Creature Glossary allows the player to view all the creatures in the game as well as all individuals of that species in the park.
                    Newly obtained species or individual creatures will have an an exclamation mark next to them. 
                    This page can be filtered similar to the Market.</p>
                <li>MODs Manager</li>
                <img src="images/MODs_Manager.webp">
                <p>The MODs Manager allows the player to view all MODs in the game and read about their effects. 
                   MODs are categorized by color and can be sorted by this criteria using the manager's sorting function.</p>
                <li>My Badges</li>
                <img src="images/My_Badges.webp">
                <p>My Badges allows the player to view their Badge progress. There is no sorting function, though completed badges are at the bottom of the list. 
                    At the top of the page, the progress towards the next Badge Beacon creature is shown.

    <p>There are four raptors in the paddock. Thier names are Blue, Charlie, Delta, and Echo. 
        When you spend coins, food or DNA, you unlock the prize wheel for the rarity level you purchased. 
        Purchasing the Common MOD prize wheel can also net you rare MODs if you're lucky. 
        Each raptor has a different selection of MODs with some overlap, so if you cannot afford to pay for one raptor's MODs, you can try a different raptor.
    </p>

    <li>2.6 Trade Harbor</li>
    <img src="images/27c4fbf7813f24617d2e.jpg" width="240">
    <p>The Trading Harbor is a feature that can be used to trade surplus currencies, buildings, and creatures for other currencies, buildings, and creatures. It is run by Chanya Diogo, who will offer 7 randomly generated trades at a time. Each trade will be available for 1hr 30min before it expires. 
        Buildings and Creatures can only be traded before they are placed or hatched, and all trades are final and cannot be refunded.
        A custom trade (or 3 with a VIP Membership) can be created every 24 hours; you can pay 250 Dino Bucks to skip this timer. Custom trades allow the user to trade a specific thing for something of their choice, e.g. Coins for a Cenozoic. 
        Not all types of trades can be done this way, however.
        Some trades are VIP exclusive. These almost always involve Loyalty Points or VIP Creatures and Buildings.

<h3>3. Buildings</h3>
<p>Buildings are type of structures that you have to spend coin to buy i. Just like Cage, buildings generate coin in a period of time to collect .

<h2>Mods</h2>
<p>Mods are items that can only be used in Modded Battle Events. 
    They allow the player to either boost their creatures or nerf the opposing team, as well as other effects such as randomizing the MODs of every creature on the field. 
    A full list of MODs and their corresponding raptors is below:
